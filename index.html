      const heading = React.createElement('h1',{},'gautam ','guddu ','baabu '); // to create elements
      // at the end createElement is just a method defined inside React object, it takes some argument and based on that it returns an
      // element(object)
      // the second parameter is used to give attributes to elements, but note that attributes name are not in html format
      // but in js, bcz write now u are setting values of javascript pre-defined objects and not writing html directly.

      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));  // root is the place where react runs.
      // The createRoot method is part of the React 18+ API and is used to initialize and manage a React //application on the DOM. It is a replacement for the older ReactDOM.render method, designed to support concurrent rendering and improve app performance.

      root.render(heading);  // what this render does is nothing but to just inject the 'heading' or any other react element by converting it to proper html element
      //based on properties of that object, which eventually is based on what arguments, we passed to React.createElement().
